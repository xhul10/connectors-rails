# Connectors
The new home of Elastic Connectors

### System Requirements
- Ruby (see [.ruby-version](.ruby-version))
- bundler 2.2.29

### Setup
1. `make install`

### Lintint
run `make lint`

### Testing
run `make test`

### Copying artifacts to Enterprise Search

Make sure you have [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/#install) installed, then:

1. run `make build`
1. cd to your ent-search checkout
1. run  `gem uninstall connectors_sdk`
1. copy the artifacts in the `.gems` directory to the `vendor/cache` directory in Enterprise Search repository.
1. run `script/bundle install`

### Running a webserver with a Connector
To run the webserver, several steps need to be made: Java artifacts built, credentials initialized and some other small things work.

First, make sure that you create a unique `api_key` for your service, with:
```shell
make api_key
```

Then, you can run all of them for now with a `make` command:

```shell
make all
```

Consumers will need to use the `api_key` string as the password in
the Authorization header.

### Configuration

By design, we try to avoid duplicating any metadata in the project, like its
**version**. For this reason, we have one single configuration file in
`config/connectors.yml` that contains all the metadata needed for runtime and
buildtime. It can be used from the dev tree or in a production deployment.

The Gem spec, the connectors and the Sinatra app use that config file to get
the metadata they need.

The build process might change it on-the-fly when the Gem is created but will
not change the one in the dev tree.

When Sinatra is launched, it will pick `config/connectors.yml` by default, 
but you can provide your own configuration file by using the **CONNECTORS_CONFIG** env.
